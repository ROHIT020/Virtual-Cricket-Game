# Virtual-Cricket-Game
This project was given to me in during Intershala C and C++ training. In this I build a cricket game application using the C++ programming language.

â–¶Implementationâœ¨
1. There should be two teams: TeamA and TeamB

Each team will have 4 players.
The players for each team will be selected by the user from the given pool of 11 players. You can assign the names to those 11 players yourself.
The sequence in which the players are selected for each team will decide the batting and bowling sequence for that team. For example, if Team A has Virat, Rohit, Dhawan, and Rahul; Virat will be the first player to bat or ball.
2. There should be two innings âœŒ

Each innings will be of 6 balls.
In each innings, only one bowler from the bowling team will bowl all the 6 deliveries and at a time one batsman from the batting team will bat until he is declared out.
The first player from the bowling team will be always selected to bowl first and the first player from the batting team will be always selected to bat first.
When a batsman is OUT, the next batsman from the batting team in sequence will start batting.
3. There should be a toss functionalityðŸ“€

The team who wins the toss will decide to either bat or bowl first
4. In each delivery, possible runs can be scored from 0 to 6

5. OUT criteria: ðŸ’¢

If a batsman scores 0 runs he will be declared OUT and the next batsman in sequence will start batting
6. Match End criteria ðŸš«

If runs scored by TeamA is greater than the opponent TeamB, then TeamA will win the game or vice-versa.
If runs scored by TeamA and TeamB are the same then the match will draw.
